# Advanced-Regression
> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. 
> The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

## General Information
> The company wants to know:
Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
How well those variables describe the price of a house.
Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

## Conclusions
- There were highly missing values, so null value treatment is required
- There were outlier treatment and categorical data analysis also performed
- From gridSearch, the for lasso we got optimum lambda to be 0.0001
- From gridSearch, the for risge we got optimum lambda to be 4

## Technologies Used
- numpy - version 1.21.6
- pandas - version 1.3.5
- seaborn - version 0.11.2
- matplotlib - version 3.2.2
- sklearn-pandas - version 1.8.0
